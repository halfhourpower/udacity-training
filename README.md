Executed Explanatory Analysis and put findings with visualizations into a slide deck in Jupyter Notebook for a presentation.
Two interesting findings were:

- Day of the week with the most riders was Monday

## A/B Test for a new landing page
●	Analyzed results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website using Python and its libraries.
The goal was to determine if the company should implement a new page design.
Random sampling was used with hypothesis testing to determine the suggested result.

## WeRateDogs twitter account

- What were the top earning movies for each decade?
- What were the most popular movies for each decade?
